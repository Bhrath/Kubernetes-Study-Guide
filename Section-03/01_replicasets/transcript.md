replicasets

replicasets are a kubernetes objects. They are controller objects. 

Kubernetes objects whose job is to create other kubernetes objects are referred to as controller objects. 


In practice you will rarely need to create replicasets, instead you'll create them indirectly by creating a higher level object called deployments.
