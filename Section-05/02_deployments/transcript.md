do in iterm2, have three panels open

2 columns, second column has two panels, up and down. 

watch kubectl get replicasets
watch kubectl get pods

actually use this to watch everything instead: 


install:
https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectl-tree




on the surface deployments and replicasets look like they do the same thing.

When I first started about deployments I thought deployments was pointless, I mean why bother with using it if you can just create a replicaset directly. It just seemd liked deployments just adds another layer of complexity.
