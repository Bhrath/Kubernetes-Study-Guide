# Upgrading Kubernetes

Kubernetes is being developed and new version are constantly being released. So it's best to stay up to date by regularly upgrading your clusters. If you provisioned your clsuter with kubeadm, then you can use kubeadm to upgrade your kubemasters. 

However for the kube workers, you can simply download the latest binaries, replace the existing binaries and restart the daemons.
