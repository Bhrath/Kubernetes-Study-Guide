zsh is now the default on macs. 

i've installed oh-my-zsh

also configured it to make it kubectl friendly. 

also using aliases. 

install 'brew install watch'

also give a quick demo of the watch command. - actually do this in a later video. 


Install process tends to change all the time, so I would recommend reading the docs for the latest instructions.
