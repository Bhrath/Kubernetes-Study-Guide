ok now let's look at what you need to know before starting this course. Kubernetes is a really powerful piece 
of software and it's also quite complex that's why you need to know some of the basics 

such as knowing your way round a Linux operating system and how to use the bash command prompt. The Linux distro 
doesn't matter that much but I'll be using Centos and Ubuntu in this course


you need hands on docker experience - mainly so that you understand the concept of containers and what docker images.

You need to be familiar with yaml files and how to write them.

you need to have some basic networking knowledge such so that you know what are IP addresses, 
network ports, network interfaces,...and etc 


This isn't a complete list of things you need to know but it does give you some idea of what 
level of knowledge you should have before continuing with this course 


now let's take a look at software requirements. You local workstation needs to have all the following software.


Most of these are general purpose tools used for software development. The only exception being the last 2, kubectl and minikube, 
these 2 are Kubernetes specific.

Probably the easiest way to install these software on a Mac is with [brew](https://brew.sh/), which itself needs to be installed. Here's an example:
