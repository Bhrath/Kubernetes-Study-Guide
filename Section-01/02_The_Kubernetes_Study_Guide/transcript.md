This course comes with is very own study guide. You can find it on 
guide on Github, so you just need to clone this repo to download it. 

This guide is made up of a number of sections and each of these 
section contains a series of topic folders. These sections and topic folders mirrors this Udemy course. So for each video in this course there is a corresponding topic folder. 

For example right now you're watching the video for this topic, the Kubernetes study guide. 

Each of these topic folders contains a readme file. These README files cover everything the videos cover, but in more detail, and they contain a lot useful links. I recommend that you review these readme files as you progress through the course.

A lot of the videos demos the use of various example Kubernete files. You can find them in the study guide as well, they are in the configs folder for the given topic folder. 

Whenever a topic has a configs folder, such as the hello worlds pods folder. I will alway go to that topic folder and open a bash terminal inside it.
