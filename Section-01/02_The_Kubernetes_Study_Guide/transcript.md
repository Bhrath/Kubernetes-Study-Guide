This course comes with is very own study guide. You can find it on Github, so you just need to clone this repo to download it. 

This guide is made up of a number of sections and each of these 
section contains a series of topic folders. These sections and topics mirrors the Udemy course. So for each video in this course there is a corresponding topic folder. 

For example, right now you're watching the video for this topic, the Kubernetes study guide. 

Each topic folder contains a readme file. These README files cover everything the videos cover, but in more detail, and they contain a lot useful links and sample commands. I recommend that you review these readme files as you progress through the course.

In a lot of the videos, we demo the use of various yaml files. You can find these files in the corresponding topic, under a folder called configs.

I will have this Study guide opened up in VS Code text editor at the start of most demos. In addition to that I'll navigate to the  video's topic folder and then open a bash terminal inside it. I'm doing this so that I can conveniently access the config files from the command line, that's because I need to refer to these files as part of the commands I'll be running.
