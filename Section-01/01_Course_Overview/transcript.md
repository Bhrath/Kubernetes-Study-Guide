Hello Everyone, my name is Sher Chowdhury and welcome to my course Kubernetes by example

I'm based in the UK and I've been working in IT for about 15 years. 

In 2019 I passed the Kubernetes exam and became a certified kubernetes administrator. If you want to get certified as well then this course is a great place to practice for the exam. That's because this course is hands-on, just like the exam itself.

This course is heavily demo based and I've designed it to make it really easy for you to copy what I do in each video. So if you follow along, then not only will you learn Kubernetes faster, but you will also:

- Setup your very own Kubernetes Environment using Minikube
- Run containers by creating pods
- Configure networkning to get pods talking to each other by creating services
- Kubernetes object manifest yaml files, quickly and easily
- Create a group of identical pods using Replicasets and Deployments
- Create Ingress rules to make your pods accessible to the outside world
- Store your pod's data securely using Persistent Volumes and Persistant Volume Claims. 
  
We'll cover all of this in just the first couple of hours of the course!

As you progress through the rest of the course you will get hands-on experience with a lot of the more advanced Kubernetes features.

We'll also provide lots of exam tips, best practice tips along the way. 

That's why I'm really excited that you have shown an interest in joining me on this journey. 

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the course.
